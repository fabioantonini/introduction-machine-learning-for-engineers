    "**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform specific tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so. Instead of following pre-defined rules, ML systems learn from data, identifying patterns and making decisions with minimal human interventin.\n",

    "### Most Important Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Supervised Learning**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** In supervised learning, the model is trained on labeled data, meaning that each input is paired with the correct output.\n",
    "   - **Examples:**\n",
    "     - **Regression:** Predicting continuous values, such as house prices or stock prices.\n",
    "     - **Classification:** Categorizing data into predefined classes, such as spam detection or image classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unsupervised Learning**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** In unsupervised learning, the model is trained on unlabeled data and must identify patterns and structures within the data.\n",
    "   - **Examples:**\n",
    "     - **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together, such as customer segmentation or document clustering.\n",
    "     - **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reducing the number of features in a dataset while retaining important information, such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or t-SNE.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reinforcement Learning**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** In reinforcement learning, the model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on its actions.\n",
