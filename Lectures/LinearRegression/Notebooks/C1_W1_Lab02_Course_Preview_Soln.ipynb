    "### Machine Learning Techniques Overview\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Machine learning encompasses a variety of techniques used to build models that can make predictions or uncover patterns in data. These techniques fall into three main categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and large language models. Here, we explore the most commonly used techniques in each category and their applications.\r\n",
