To create a virtual environment in Anaconda for running Jupyter Notebooks with TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment
Open the Anaconda Prompt and execute the following commands:

```sh
# Create a new virtual environment named 'tf-env'
conda create --name tf-env-11 python=3.10
```

Replace `3.10` with your preferred Python version if needed.

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment
```sh
# Activate the newly created environment
conda activate tf-env-3.10
```

### 3. Install Jupyter Notebook
```sh
# Install Jupyter Notebook
conda install jupyter
```

### 4. Install TensorFlow
```sh
# Install TensorFlow
conda install tensorflow
```

### 5. Install Scikit-Learn
```sh
# Install Scikit-Learn
conda install scikit-learn
```

### 6. Install Other Required Dependencies
Depending on your specific needs, you might need additional packages. Commonly required packages include `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`:

```sh
# Install additional packages
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib ipympl
```

### 7. Launch Jupyter Notebook
With all necessary packages installed, you can now start Jupyter Notebook:

```sh
# Launch Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook
```

This will open Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser. You can then create new notebooks or open existing ones and start working with TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn.

### Summary of Required Dependencies for TensorFlow
Here are the key dependencies typically required for TensorFlow:

1. **Python** (3.6, 3.7, or 3.8 are usually recommended)
2. **pip** (to install TensorFlow and other packages)
3. **numpy** (often a dependency for TensorFlow)
4. **protobuf** (used for TensorFlow's protocol buffers)
5. **six** (a Python 2 and 3 compatibility library)
6. **h5py** (to read and write HDF5 files, commonly used for saving models)
7. **termcolor** (for color formatting in terminal outputs)

By following the above steps, you should have a fully functional environment for running TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn in Jupyter Notebooks.
